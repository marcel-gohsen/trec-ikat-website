## **Introduction to TREC Interactive Knowledge Assistance Track**

The widespread adoption of voice-based assistants is significantly changing how we interact with technology. According to a [Comscore report](https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Blog/Smart-Speaker-Penetration-Hits-20-Percent-of-US-Wi-Fi-Households), over 20% of U.S. households now own a smart speaker. This trend is further exemplified by the recent introduction of assistant-enabled smart glasses by major tech companies, pushing the boundaries of real-world applications.

Despite their proficiency in executing simple, well-defined tasks, these assistants still face limitations in supporting conversational information seeking (CIS). CIS is crucial within fields such as information retrieval, natural language processing, and dialogue systems, focusing on tasks like ranking, summarizing, and question answering.

The TREC Interactive Knowledge Assistance Track (iKAT) builds on the four years of success of the TREC Conversational Assistance Track (CAsT), which can be explored further [here](https://www.treccast.ai/). iKAT is designed to research and develop conversational agents that excel in collaborative information seeking by personalizing responses based on user-derived insights.

CAsT's fourth year introduced more interactive elements, such as clarifications and suggestions, fostering multi-turn, multi-path conversations. iKAT evolves from CAsT with a renewed focus on supporting diverse, multi-turn conversations tailored to the user’s background, perspective, and context. This means that for any given topic, the flow and substance of the conversation can vary significantly depending on the user’s individual traits and needs.

iKAT's primary goal is to advance research on conversational agents that not only respond to users’ immediate queries but also adapt their responses based on the cumulative context of the interaction. This aspect of personalization is particularly timely with the advancements in large language models (LLMs), which introduce new challenges and opportunities in the dynamic interplay of user context, system promptings, and conversational initiatives.
